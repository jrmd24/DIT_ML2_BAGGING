# DIT_ML2_BAGGING

This code implements custom Random Forest baggig model based on decision trees.

Analysis of model variance is performed using training dataset built from boostrap sampled copies of the titanic dataset. 

The artefacts produced by the code will be placed in a folder named "output" at the same location as the one of the "BaggingModeling.py" python script
